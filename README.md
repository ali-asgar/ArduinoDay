# ArduinoDay
The passion to teach has always stayed with me.

Conducted the Arduino Day 2019 hands-on training session for 70+ participants on March 16th at NJIT.
Organized By IEEE, ACM, ASME, GSA, Student Senate, and IEEE North Jersey Section.

This full day training session was focussed on Fast Prototyping. Participants learnt how to build a complete system from scratch and use them in different applications.

Arduino Day 2019 held simultaneously on March 16th 2019 had 659 events in 106 countries.

This repository contains codes for "Fast Prototyping" of various sensors.

### Installing the multi-function shield library

You will need to first install the following libraries:
1. [TimerOne](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne)
2. [Software I2C](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/SoftwareI2CLibrary) 
3. [Multi-function Shield Library](http://files.cohesivecomputing.co.uk/MultiFuncShield-Library.zip)

libraries using instructions for [installing Arduino libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries).

If for any reason you haven’t been successful installing any of the libraries, then download this
repository instead, unzip and copy all the folders to your Documents\Arduino\libraries folder (if using
Windows) or OS equivalent.
