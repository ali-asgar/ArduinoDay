# Arduino Day



[Arduino Day 2019](https://day.arduino.cc) was a hands-on training session conducted for 70+ participants on March 16th at NJIT. Organized By IEEE, ACM, ASME, GSA, Student Senate, and IEEE North Jersey Section. This full day training session was focussed on Fast Prototyping. Participants learnt how to build a complete system from scratch and use them in different applications. **Arduino Day 2019 held simultaneously on March 16th 2019 had 659 events in 106 countries.**

The ArduinoDay repository contains all the codes for hands-on training on Arduino Uno. The repository makes use of TimerOne library, LCM, SoftI2CMaster library, MultiFuncShield library, and DHT library.

##Setting up prerequisites
Clone this repository to your **/Documents/Arduino/libraries folder**.

### Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Multi-function Shield
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- HC SR-04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LDR Light Sensor
- A to B Cable
- Jumper Cables

### Installing the multi-function shield library
[Reference Documentation](https://www.mpja.com/download/hackatronics-arduino-multi-function-shield.pdf): Kashif Baig, 2015 cohesivecomputing.co.uk

You will need to first install the following:
1. [TimerOne Library](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne)
2. [Software I2C Library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/SoftwareI2CLibrary) 
3. [Multi-function Shield Library](http://files.cohesivecomputing.co.uk/MultiFuncShield-Library.zip)
4. [Programs](http://files.cohesivecomputing.co.uk/Hackatronics-Using-Arduino-Multi-function-Shield.zip)

libraries using instructions for [installing Arduino libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries).

If for any reason you haven’t been successful installing any of the libraries, then download this
repository instead, unzip and copy all the folders to your Documents\Arduino\libraries folder (if using
Windows) or OS equivalent.

I must point out that by following the contents of the repository, you agree to do so at your own risk, and
agree to take full responsibility for any loss or damages you may incur upon yourself or others. If
you’re a kid starting out, be sure to have supervision of a responsible adult.

Start coding and have fun!
